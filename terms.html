				</div>
				<div class="elem__document">
					<h6>Ordering</h6>
					<p>Orders of Product(s) are subject to availability. When you place an order, we will confirm it by email, but the order will only become legally binding on us when we send you an email confirming dispatch of the Product(s). If we cannot fulfil your order for any reason, we will notify you as soon as we reasonably can.</p>
					<p>We try to ensure that product details displayed on the Website are correct and up-to-date. However, any error or omission in any information on the Website, or in any other communication or document issued by us, may be corrected without any liability on our part. You will then be given the option of re-confirming your order at the correct price or cancelling your order. If you have already paid for the Product(s) at the erroneous price, you will receive a full refund if you decide to cancel.
					Images of products on the Website are intended as a guide and the actual product may differ slightly in some respects. All weights and dimensions given are approximate.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="elem__document">
					<h6>Payment</h6>
					<p>All Product prices shown on the Website are inclusive of any applicable UK VAT. Where you have requested delivery of your Order to an EU country, the total cost of your Order will include UK VAT. Where you have requested delivery of your Order to a non-EU country, the total cost of your Order will not include UK VAT. However, it will include sales tax if appropriate which will be added to your Order at checkout and paid on your behalf by us to the relevant local customs authorities. Please note that if you are ordering goods for delivery outside of the EU, please check what taxes or duties may apply, as you will have to pay these yourself. We are not responsible for the charges you may have to pay once the Product(s) reach the destination country.</p>
					<p>The prices shown do not include the delivery fee, which will be added to your total order price.</p>
					<p>Orders must be paid for immediately by credit or debit card. If we cannot accept your order for any reason, we will process a full refund within seven days.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="elem__document">
					<h6>Delivery</h6>
					<p>We will endeavour to deliver the Product(s) as soon as possible after confirmation of your order. However, we cannot accept responsibility for loss or damage caused by any delay in delivering the Product(s). We will try to keep you informed in the event of any delay.</p>
					<p>Delivery will be to the address specified by you when ordering. If you are ordering goods for delivery outside of the EU, please check what taxes or duties may apply, as you will have to pay these yourself. We are not responsible for the charges you may have to pay once the product(s) reach the destination country.
					As soon as the Product(s) are delivered to you, you become the owner of those Product(s) and the risk will passed to you. This means that you will be liable for any subsequent damage, loss or destruction to the Product(s).
					Orders for next day delivery are dispatched from our UK warehouse on the same day if placed before 12pm Mon-Fri, and the next business day if placed after. We aim to despatch all other orders within 2 working days. During busy periods despatch and delivery times may be longer than usual.
					Please note that we are unable to influence the delivery of any parcels once they have left our warehouse. Please ensure you have entered the correct delivery details prior to confirming your order. If we are unable to deliver due to wrong information being input at the order stage you will still be charged for all original and additional redelivery costs. If your order has been lost or was unable to be delivered to you please contact us after 5 days (for UK orders) and after 2 weeks (for international orders). Please note that we will try our best to resolve this issue but we may refund your order after a second failed delivery attempt.  </p>
					<p>If we have been unable to deliver your parcel and it is returned to our warehouse we will contact you regarding a refund. If we do not receive instructions from you within 2 weeks we will automatically refund your order.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="elem__document">
					<h6>International Orders</h6>
					<p>International orders are either sent via Royal Mail Tracked and Signed or via a Courier service depending on order size and weight. You will receive tracking information on dispatch by email.
					In some instances once the parcel has left the UK we will be unable to track your parcel. Unfortunately we are unable to influence the delivery. Please try contacting your local postal agent/office; they may be able to help.
					For overseas orders our delivery charges vary, the charge will be calculated in the checkout once you have entered your delivery address.
